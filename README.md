**Python Rideshare Plotting Project** 

The Pyber project involved analyzing data from a ridesharing company to determine the total riders, average fare cost, and number of drivers grouped by city type (urban, suburban, and rural). This project used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

**Key Findings**

The urban cities had dramatically more total riders, followed by suburban cities, and rural cities had the fewest riders. 

Urban cities, unsurpringly, also had more drivers than suburban cities, with rural cities having the fewest. 

Average fares were more expensive in rural areas than urban areas. This is likely attributable to riders needing to travel shorter distances in denser, urban environments.
